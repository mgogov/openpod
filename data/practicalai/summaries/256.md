In the *Practical AI* episode featuring a *Fully Connected* discussion between co-hosts Daniel Whitenack and Chris Benson, several key themes in the AI world were explored. Here's a summary:

### Main Topics Discussed:

1. **AI Voice Regulation by FCC:** A significant focus was on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s decision to regulate AI voices in robocalls, specifically citing an instance where an AI voice clone of President Biden was used in a deceptive manner. The discussion highlighted ethical concerns and the potential for AI technologies to be misused in misinformation campaigns.

2. **Developments in AI Models:** The episode touched on recent developments in AI models, particularly Google's Gemini, which represents Google's effort in the generative AI space, aiming to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT. The conversation noted Gemini's initial reception and its comparison to other AI models in terms of capabilities and performance.

3. **Multimodal AI and Industry Innovations:** Attention was given to the ongoing trend towards multimodality in AI, with companies like Apple and others releasing models that can handle tasks beyond text, such as image editing and analysis. This segment of the discussion underscored the evolution and expansion of AI applications across different media types.

4. **AI for Data Analysis and SQL Generation:** A notable topic was the use of AI, particularly generative models, for data analysis tasks. The co-hosts discussed how these models are increasingly being used to generate SQL queries from natural language prompts, facilitating data analytics without the need for direct model-based computation.

5. **AI Integration in Education:** The episode addressed the integration of AI tools in educational settings, acknowledging the challenges teachers face due to system policies and the potential benefits of utilizing AI for enhancing learning experiences. Chris Benson offered an apology for a previous comment on this topic, emphasizing support for teachers seeking to incorporate AI responsibly.

6. **Hybrid AI Methods and Practical Applications:** The conversation delved into the potential of hybrid AI methods, combining traditional data science techniques with natural language interfaces provided by generative AI models. This approach allows for more effective and user-friendly applications of AI in fields like forecasting and analytics.

### Key Takeaways:
