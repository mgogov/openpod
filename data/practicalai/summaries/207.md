# Practical AI: Machine Learning in Small Organizations

## Overview
This episode of Practical AI focuses on the unique opportunities and challenges of implementing machine learning (ML) and data science in small organizations. Featuring Kirsten Lum, co-founder and CPO of Storytellers AI, the discussion explores how small companies can leverage ML for growth, the necessity of a broad skill set for data scientists in these settings, and strategies for effective project management and integration within the existing business framework.

## Major Themes

- **Adapting to Small Organizations**: The conversation underscores the adaptability required in small organizations where resources are limited. Data scientists need to manage a wide range of tasks from data gathering and cleaning to model deployment, often with less specialization than their counterparts in larger companies.

- **Project Management and Communication**: Effective project management and communication within the organization are highlighted as critical factors for the success of ML projects in small teams. Tools like Trello and Google Sheets are recommended for their simplicity and flexibility in managing projects and fostering collaboration.

- **Building Trust and Demonstrating Value**: Building trust with stakeholders and clearly demonstrating the value of ML projects are essential. This includes educating non-technical team members on the benefits of data science and maintaining open lines of communication about project goals, progress, and outcomes.

- **Navigating Organizational Dynamics**: The discussion also touches on the importance of understanding and navigating the organizational dynamics in small companies, including working closely with other departments and aligning ML projects with the companyâ€™s broader objectives and constraints.

- **The Role of Generalist Skills**: For data scientists in small organizations, having a broad set of skills that cover the entire data science workflow is crucial. This generalist approach allows them to effectively tackle the diverse challenges encountered in smaller settings, from data preparation to model deployment.

## Memorable Quotes

- **"I actually learned Python to do it. It took me two weeks to learn enough Python just convert this process into a Python process."** - *Kirsten Lum* discussing her initial foray into automating a marketing process, highlighting the DIY spirit often necessary in small organizations.

- **"Just use gradient boosted trees; that's your baseline."** - *Kirsten Lum* offering practical advice for model selection in small organizations, emphasizing the importance of efficiency and simplicity in choosing modeling techniques.

- **"So data scientists have that same kind of role. They're always going to need to pull the data together, build that model, explain it to the person, explain how to integrate it..."** - *Kirsten Lum* on the comprehensive role of data scientists in small settings, where they must not only develop models but also ensure their integration and application within the business.

## Actionable Takeaways

- **For Aspiring Data Scientists**: Consider starting your career in a mid to larger-sized organization to gain exposure to a wide range of data science practices before moving to a smaller company where you may have to operate more independently.

- **For Small Business Leaders**: Embrace the potential of ML and data science, recognizing that even small organizations can leverage these technologies for significant business advantages. Start by identifying clear, achievable projects where ML can provide measurable benefits.

- **For Data Scientists in Small Teams**: Develop a generalist skill set that covers the entire data science lifecycle, from data handling to model deployment. Utilize simple, flexible project management tools to keep projects on track and maintain open communication with team members.

## Conclusion
The episode sheds light on the unique aspects of applying machine learning within small organizations, highlighting the need for data scientists to adopt a versatile, generalist approach. By effectively managing projects, building trust across the organization, and demonstrating the tangible benefits of ML, small teams can successfully implement data science initiatives to drive business growth and innovation.
