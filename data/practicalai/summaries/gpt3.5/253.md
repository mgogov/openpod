## Episode: The Future of Language Models

### Overview
In this episode of Conversations on AI, Daniel Whitenack speaks with Raza Habib about the future of language models (LLMs) and their impact on various industries. They discuss the development stages of LLM applications, the importance of evaluation metrics, and the trend of fine-tuning models. Habib also highlights the significance of prompt engineering and the growing complexity of LLM applications.

### Major themes
- **Development stages of LLM applications**:
  - Understanding the different stages of development, from prototyping to production, is crucial for building effective LLM applications. Evaluation metrics play a vital role in assessing model performance and refining the application.
- **Importance of prompt engineering**:
  - Prompt engineering is a powerful technique for optimizing LLM outputs and ensuring they align with the desired outcomes. It allows users to influence the behavior of the model and improve its performance without extensive fine-tuning.
- **Trends in fine-tuning models**:
  - While fine-tuning models remain relevant for certain use cases, such as optimizing costs and latency or enforcing specific output constraints, prompt engineering often offers a faster and more efficient solution. Understanding when to utilize fine-tuning versus prompt engineering is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of LLM applications.

### Memorable quotes
- **"Prompt engineering is usually where most people start, and sometimes where people finish as well."**
  - *Raza Habib*
  - Habib emphasizes the significance of prompt engineering as a rapid and impactful method for optimizing LLM outputs.
