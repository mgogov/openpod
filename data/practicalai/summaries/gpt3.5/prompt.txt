The total length of the content that I want to send you is too large to send in only one piece.
        
For sending you that content, I will follow this rule:
        
[START PART 1/10]
this is the content of the part 1 out of 10 in total
[END PART 1/10]
        
Then you just answer: "Received part 1/10"
        
And when I tell you "ALL PARTS SENT", then you can continue processing the data and answering my requests.

======

Do not answer yet. This is just another part of the text I want to send you. Just receive and acknowledge as "Part 1/3 received" and wait for the next part.
[START PART 1/3]

<add next chunk of content>

[END PART 1/3]
Remember not answering yet. Just acknowledge you received this part with the message "Part 1/3 received" and wait for the next part.

======

Do not answer yet. This is just another part of the text I want to send you. Just receive and acknowledge as "Part 2/3 received" and wait for the next part.
[START PART 2/3]

<add next chunk of content>

[END PART 2/3]
Remember not answering yet. Just acknowledge you received this part with the message "Part 2/3 received" and wait for the next part.

======

[START PART 3/3]

<add next chunk of content>

[END PART 3/3]
ALL PARTS SENT. Now you can continue processing the request.

You are an AI assistant and I want you to summarize podcast transcripts for me.

Use regular text style everywhere, unless otherwise specified.

Here is the structure of a summary.

Start with a h1 heading which states:
* the name of the podcast
* a : seperator
* the title of the episode

Then organize it into sections, each section starting with a h2 heading, followed by a body of text:

1) Overview

2) Major themes
Provide a list of major themes, where each major theme includes:
* a several word gist of the major theme, in bold text style
* a : separator
* up to three sentences describing the major theme in more detailTry to provide key insights and lessons that are important, if any.

3) Memorable quotes
Provide a list of memorable quotes, where each memorable quote includes:
* the actual quote, in bold text style
* a : separator
* who said it, in italic text style
* a - separator
* what was the context in the conversation for the person to say it

4) Actionable takeaways
Provide a list of actionable takeaways, where each actionable takeaway includes:
* a very brief prefix on who is this takeaway for, in bold text style
* a : separator
* a several word description of what is the gist of the takeaway, in bold text style
* a - separator
* one or two sentences describing the takeaway in more detail

5) Conclusion

Always follow this structure, never deviate from it.
