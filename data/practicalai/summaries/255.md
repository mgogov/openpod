This episode of *Practical AI* features a conversation with Karan Malhotra, co-founder and researcher at Nous Research, shedding light on the organic evolution of Nous Research from a collaborative effort into a significant open-source AI research organization and a recently established corporation following a $5.2 million seed financing round.

### Key Themes and Takeaways:

- **Origin and Growth of Nous Research:** Malhotra shares the journey of Nous Research, which began as a collaborative effort between enthusiasts in the open-source AI space. This organic growth was catalyzed by their work with models like LLaMA and their development of Hermes, leveraging synthetic data for fine-tuning. The collective rapidly expanded, supported by a decentralized and inclusive culture that encouraged contributions from diverse members worldwide.

- **Approach to AI Model Development:** Nous focuses on using synthetic data for fine-tuning models, emphasizing data distillation and knowledge compression. This methodology allows smaller models to exhibit competencies similar to larger counterparts like GPT-3 or GPT-4, ensuring efficiency and accessibility. They've also explored various training techniques and innovations such as model merging, activations hacking, and alternative sampling methods to enhance model performance.

- **Community and Collaboration:** Malhotra highlights the importance of community in Nous Research's development. The organization's structure facilitates cross-collaboration among members with different expertise, fostering a culture of shared learning and mutual growth. This ethos reflects a broader sentiment within the AI community towards democratizing access to advanced AI technologies.

- **Future Directions:** Despite transitioning into a corporation, Nous Research remains committed to its open-source roots, aiming to develop tools and services that empower the community and enhance the utility of open models. Their vision includes making advanced AI tools more accessible and effective for a broader audience, aligning with their ethos of empowering individuals and promoting innovation.

- **Advice for AI Practitioners:** Malhotra offers practical advice for those fine-tuning AI models, emphasizing the significance of hyperparameters, continuous training, and innovative instruction formats. He encourages exploring novel approaches to model training and adaptation, such as soft prompting and activation adjustments, to unlock new capabilities and applications.

### Conclusion:
Nous Research exemplifies the transformative potential of collaborative, open-source initiatives in the AI field. Their journey from a grassroots collective to a burgeoning corporation underscores the power of community-driven innovation and the enduring importance of accessibility and empowerment in the evolving landscape of AI technology.
