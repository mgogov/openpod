This episode of *Practical AI* kicks off 2024 with a "Fully Connected" session where co-hosts Daniel Whitenack and Chris Benson reflect on the transformative year of 2023 for AI, particularly generative AI, and share their insights and predictions for 2024.

### Highlights and Insights:

- **2023 in Review**: 2023 saw big tech companies deeply embedding AI into their ecosystems, with generative AI taking center stage. The year was marked by significant advancements and widespread adoption of models like ChatGPT, GPT-4, and others, sparking an AI arms race among tech giants.

- **AI Integration into Daily Workflows**: Both hosts have integrated various AI models into their daily workflows, noting that 2023 was the year AI tools became indispensable for productivity in both professional and personal contexts. This shift signifies a broader acceptance and utility of AI across different facets of life.

- **Challenges and Opportunities**: The rapid evolution of AI technologies also brings challenges, particularly in terms of ethics, regulation, and the fear of AI's impact on society. Yet, 2023 laid the groundwork for addressing these issues through policy initiatives and a growing emphasis on responsible AI development.

- **Predictions for 2024**:
    1. **Increased Focus on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Improvements in RAG systems are anticipated to continue, enabling more sophisticated and contextual AI responses.
    2. **Dominance of Open Models**: Open-source models are expected to surpass the capabilities of proprietary models like GPT-4 in certain domains.
    3. **AI as a Productivity Enhancer**: AI will enhance work productivity rather than replace human jobs, with a shift towards AI-assisted workflows.
    4. **Rise of Multimodal Models**: 2024 may see a greater emphasis on models that can understand and generate content across different modalities (text, image, audio).
    5. **Shift to Smaller Language Models**: Due to economic and computational efficiencies, there will be a move towards smaller, more specialized models.

- **Insights from Industry Leaders**: The episode highlights perspectives from industry experts like Clem Delangue of Hugging Face and Jerry Talton of LLaMA Index, who emphasize the importance of focusing on software engineering principles, the cost-efficiency of AI models, and the potential consolidation within the AI industry.

- **Conclusion and Looking Ahead**: As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of life and work, 2024 promises further advancements and challenges. The hosts express their eagerness to continue exploring the AI landscape with their listeners, encouraging community engagement and dialogue on emerging AI trends and developments.
