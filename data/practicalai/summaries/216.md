# Practical AI: Exploring AI Explainability and Delivery with Beth Rudden

## Overview

In this episode of Practical AI, hosts Daniel Whitenack and Chris Benson are joined by Beth Rudden, CEO of bast.ai, to discuss the critical topics of AI explainability and accountability. Beth shares her journey from being a data scientist at IBM to focusing on the semantic aspects of AI and the importance of creating explainable AI systems.

## Major Themes

**Explainability and Accountability in AI:**
Beth emphasizes the necessity of developing AI systems that are not only advanced but also explainable and accountable. She discusses the journey from her early days in data science to her focus on linguistics and semantics, highlighting the importance of these fields in making AI understandable and responsible.

**The Role of Ontologies in AI:**
Beth introduces the concept of using ontologies and knowledge graphs as foundational elements to improve natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) in AI systems. This approach allows for creating conversational AI that has a lineage and provenance, making AI responses more accurate and trustworthy.

**AI as a Utility:**
The discussion explores the idea of treating generative AI models as utilities, similar to dictionaries or thesauruses, to ensure they are used responsibly and efficiently. Beth advocates for the importance of user engagement and the potential for AI to augment human abilities, not replace them.

## Memorable Quotes

**"Explainability and accountability of AI systems... It's hard, because you actually have to submit several projects that say 'Here's how I took my problem and put it into a hypothesis that could be tested.'"** - *Beth Rudden*, explaining the rigorous process behind ensuring AI systems are explainable and accountable.

**"I'm always 'Why can't we carry a pocket brain like we carry a pocket GPS?'"** - *Beth Rudden*, advocating for AI to augment human intelligence and capabilities.

## Actionable Takeaways

**For AI Researchers and Developers:**
- **Emphasize Explainability** - Focus on developing AI systems that are not just powerful but also explainable to users. This includes using ontologies and knowledge graphs to improve NLU and NLG.
  
**For General AI Users:**
- **Engage Actively with AI** - Use AI as a tool to augment your capabilities, asking it about familiar topics to understand its limitations and strengths.

**For AI Investors and Entrepreneurs:**
- **Invest in User-Friendly AI** - Support projects that aim to make AI more accessible and understandable to the general public, promoting AI as a utility that can enhance everyday life.

## Conclusion

The conversation with Beth Rudden highlights the critical importance of explainability and accountability in AI systems. By focusing on semantic understanding and user engagement, there is a path forward to creating AI that not only advances technology but also enriches human life. The episode encourages a broader discussion on the responsible use of AI and the potential for these technologies to open up new opportunities for creativity and learning.
