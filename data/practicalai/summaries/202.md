# Practical AI: Fully Connected - AI Controversies and Learning Resources

## Overview

In this "Fully Connected" episode of the Practical AI podcast, co-hosts Daniel Whitenack and Chris Benson dive into discussions on AI controversies, particularly focusing on GitHub Copilot and the Galactica model. Recorded on the eve of Thanksgiving, the conversation explores the implications of these controversies on the AI community and introduces a new learning resource for data scientists.

## Major themes

**GitHub Copilot's Legal and Ethical Dilemmas**: GitHub Copilot, an AI programming assistant, faces criticism and legal challenges over its use of copyrighted code without attribution. This situation highlights the complex intersection of AI technology, copyright law, and open-source licensing, raising questions about the responsible use of AI in software development.

**The Galactica Model Misfires**: Meta AI's Galactica, trained on a vast corpus of scientific literature, aimed to organize and generate scientific knowledge. However, it has been criticized for generating inaccurate and potentially harmful content, showcasing the challenges in creating AI systems that reliably produce truthful and safe outputs.

**AI Deployment and Public Perception**: Both controversies underline the importance of how AI technologies are introduced and communicated to the public. Setting realistic expectations and being transparent about an AI system's capabilities and limitations are crucial in building trust and effectively integrating AI into society.
