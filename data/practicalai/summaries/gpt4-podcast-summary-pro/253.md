In this episode of *Practical AI*, Daniel Whitenack discusses with Dr. Raza Habib, the CEO and co-founder of Humanloop, the evolution and challenges in working with large language models (LLMs) in industry applications. The conversation delves into how Humanloop addresses critical issues related to managing prompts, developing workflows, and facilitating collaboration among team members with varying technical skills.

**Key Insights:**

- **Transition to LLMs:** Dr. Habib shares his journey to focusing on LLMs, driven by the realization of their potential not just in performance but also in usability. This shift made AI models customizable through natural language instructions, broadening accessibility.

- **Challenges with LLMs:** Despite their advantages, LLMs introduce complexities around managing and versioning prompts, as well as evaluating model performance due to the subjective nature of generative AI's outputs.

- **Role of Domain Expertise:** The conversation highlights the shift towards involving domain experts and product managers in prompt engineering, acknowledging their crucial role in developing effective AI applications.

- **Collaboration and Workflow Tools:** Humanloop's development stemmed from the need for tools that support collaborative workflows and manage the lifecycle of AI applications, integrating both technical and non-technical team members.

- **Evolving Application Development:** The discussion also covers the dynamics of modern AI application development, emphasizing the blend of technical orchestration and domain-specific input to refine and deploy AI models effectively.

- **Future Directions:** Dr. Habib expresses excitement about the rapid progress in AI, particularly around multimodal models and agent-based systems, and shares Humanloop's vision for becoming a proactive platform that suggests improvements to applications based on evaluation data.

**Memorable Quotes:**

- "It was the first time that instead of having to hand-annotate a new dataset for every new problem, there was this new way of customizing AI models, which was that you could write instructions in natural language." - Raza Habib

- "The best people to do prompt engineering tend to have domain expertise... But you also have this new artifact lying around, which is the prompt, and it has a similar impact to code on your end application." - Raza Habib

- "One of the most exciting things about LLMs and the progress in AI in general is that product managers and subject matter experts can for the first time be very directly involved in implementing these applications." - Raza Habib

**Takeaways:**

- The integration of LLMs into industry workflows necessitates innovative approaches to prompt management and model evaluation, highlighting the importance of tools that enable effective collaboration across diverse teams.
- Domain expertise plays a pivotal role in the success of AI applications, underscoring the need for platforms that facilitate direct involvement of non-technical stakeholders in the development process.
- As AI technology continues to evolve, platforms like Humanloop are critical for enabling organizations to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by advanced models, moving towards more proactive and intelligent systems.
