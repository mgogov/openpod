# Practical AI: Unbabel's Innovations in Machine Translation

## Overview

This episode of Practical AI features Daniel Whitenack in conversation with Ricardo Rei and José Souza from Unbabel, recorded at the EMNLP 2022 conference in Abu Dhabi. The discussion delves into Unbabel's unique approach to combining machine translation (MT) with human post-editing, leveraging innovative quality estimation techniques to optimize the translation process.

## Major Themes

**Combining Machine Translation and Human Expertise**: Unbabel stands out in the translation industry by integrating machine translation with professional human translators. This hybrid approach aims to scale translation processes efficiently, ensuring both speed and accuracy.

**Quality Estimation and Evaluation**: Unbabel focuses on quality estimation, developing metrics and tools like COMET to assess the accuracy of machine translations. These technologies enable Unbabel to determine whether a human post-edit should be employed, based on the quality of the machine-generated translation.

**Innovation in Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation**: The discussion highlights the limitations of traditional MT evaluation metrics like BLEU and introduces COMET, a metric developed by Unbabel. COMET utilizes advanced embeddings and fine-tuning techniques to offer more nuanced and accurate assessments of translation quality.

**Challenges in MT Evaluation**: The conversation also touches on the ongoing challenges in MT evaluation, such as dealing with the nuances of different languages, named entity translations, and ensuring the discriminative power of embeddings. These challenges are crucial for further advancements in MT evaluation and quality estimation.

## Memorable Quotes

**"If you have a mechanism that tells you that your machine translation output is perfect, then you don't need the human. But for you to do this, you clearly need a very reliable, quality estimation system."** - *Ricardo Rei*, emphasizing the importance of accurate quality estimation in Unbabel's translation process.

**"We are the pioneers to use something called quality estimation to actually decide whether if we should post-edit or not the translations."** - *José Souza*, on Unbabel's innovative approach to optimizing the translation workflow.

**"COMET takes advantage of the presentations coming from large language models... These representations allow you to compare words in an embedding space; two words that might not be exactly the same, but have the exact same meaning - COMET will use those representations to output a score."** - *Ricardo Rei*, describing how COMET differentiates from traditional lexical metrics like BLEU.

## Actionable Takeaways

**For Translation Professionals**: **Integrate Quality Estimation into Workflows** - Adopt quality estimation technologies to enhance translation accuracy and efficiency, enabling a more scalable and cost-effective translation process.

**For NLP Researchers**: **Explore Dynamic Adaptation and Model Compression** - Investigate innovative techniques such as dynamic adaptation and model compression to address the challenges of large model sizes and the need for specific domain translations.

**For Companies and Organizations**: **Consider Hybrid Translation Models** - Evaluate the integration of machine translation and human expertise in translation workflows to improve both the speed and quality of translated content.

## Conclusion

The conversation with Unbabel's Ricardo Rei and José Souza at EMNLP 2022 sheds light on the cutting-edge developments in machine translation, emphasizing the significance of quality estimation and evaluation in enhancing translation services. By leveraging advanced NLP technologies and innovative approaches, Unbabel is pioneering a hybrid model that promises to revolutionize the translation industry, offering scalable, accurate, and efficient solutions.
