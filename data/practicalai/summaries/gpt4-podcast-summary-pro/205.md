# Practical AI: EMNLP Conference Insights and Multilingual AI

## Overview
In this episode of Practical AI, Daniel Whitenack hosts a discussion at the EMNLP Conference in Abu Dhabi with experts Andiswa Bukula, Rooweither Mabuya, Just Zwennicker, and Bonaventure Dossou. The conversation centers on the challenges and opportunities in developing Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies for under-resourced languages, highlighting the importance of collaboration between linguists and NLP practitioners.

## Major Themes

**Preservation and Digitization of Under-Resourced Languages**: The need to preserve linguistic diversity through technology is emphasized. The discussion points to the importance of digitizing content in local languages to prevent them from extinction and make them accessible for computational use.

**Collaboration Across Disciplines**: The guests highlight the essential collaboration between linguists and NLP researchers to improve the development of language technologies. Such partnerships ensure that models consider the unique morphological and structural aspects of each language.

**Empowering Indigenous Languages**: Efforts are being made to ensure languages like isiXhosa, isiZulu, and Sranan Tongo are represented in digital spaces. This includes creating resources and tools for languages that have traditionally been marginalized or overlooked in the digital domain.

**Data Challenges for Under-Resourced Languages**: A significant challenge discussed is the lack of digital data available for many languages. Innovative methods for data collection and the creation of open-source repositories are necessary to advance NLP in these languages.

## Memorable Quotes

**"We keep saying 'under-resourced, under-resourced,' until what? Like, we've been saying that our languages have been under-resourced for many years now."** - *Andiswa Bukula*, emphasizing the urgency in addressing the data scarcity for African languages.

**"Each language has a unique structure...the people that actually build tools need to have that in mind."** - *Rooweither Mabuya*, on the need for language models to account for the diverse linguistic features across languages.

**"Language preservation is very important. Let's find ways in which we can preserve our languages, in the sense that they do not go extinct."** - *Andiswa Bukula*, advocating for the digitization and preservation of linguistic heritage.

## Actionable Takeaways

**For linguists and NLP researchers**: **Collaborate on language technology projects** - Engage in interdisciplinary projects to leverage both linguistic knowledge and computational techniques, ensuring technologies are inclusive of diverse linguistic structures.

**For community members**: **Participate in digitizing local content** - Contribute to the creation of digital archives for under-resourced languages, either by digitizing existing materials or creating new content.

**For developers**: **Design inclusive NLP models** - Consider the unique aspects of various languages when developing NLP models, aiming for broader linguistic inclusivity.

## Conclusion
The discussion at the EMNLP Conference brings to light the critical role of collaboration in advancing NLP for under-resourced languages. By bridging the gap between linguistics and computer science, and through community-driven efforts to digitize and preserve linguistic data, the field can move towards truly multilingual AI that serves the global community.
