In this *Fully Connected* episode of the *Practical AI* podcast, co-hosts Daniel Whitenack and Chris Benson delve into the rapid advancements and practical applications of AI technologies, especially focusing on developments in object detection models like YOLOv9 and innovations in large language models (LLMs) for efficient computing at the edge.

### Discussion Highlights:

- **AI-Driven Personal Devices:** Daniel shares observations on the use of facial recognition technologies in airports for boarding and border crossings, emphasizing the efficiency and potential edge computing aspects of these systems.

- **YOLOv9 Release:** The conversation shifts to the recent release of YOLOv9, a continuation in the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series known for its efficient, real-time object detection capabilities. They discuss the model's improvements in efficiency and the innovative architecture aimed at reducing the information bottleneck in neural networks.

- **Programmable Gradient Information (PGI):** YOLOv9 introduces PGI, which incorporates an auxiliary, reversible branch to preserve information during the training process. This feature is designed to optimize the model's informational efficiency and can be "unbolted" during inference to maintain computational speed.

- **Generalized Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (GELAN):** They also highlight GELAN, which aggregates features and gradients more efficiently, contributing to YOLOv9's enhanced performance with fewer parameters.

- **1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs):** The discussion touches on the development of 1-bit LLMs, specifically Microsoft's BitNet, which promises similar performance to traditional models but with significantly increased computational efficiency. This advancement could enable more widespread use of LLMs in edge computing scenarios.

- **MLOps and Deployment Strategies:** Daniel and Chris explore the evolving landscape of machine learning operations (MLOps) and the integration of AI models into software architectures. They discuss how deployment strategies may vary based on the project stage, use case, and operational environment, suggesting a both/and approach to running models both locally and in the cloud.

- **Learning Resources:** They recommend resources for listeners interested in diving deeper into MLOps and practical AI deployment, including the MLOps Community podcast and Intel's free MLOps professional certification course.
