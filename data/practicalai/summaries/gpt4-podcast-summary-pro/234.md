In this episode of the Practical AI podcast, co-hosts Daniel Whitenack and Chris Benson delve deep into the world of vector databases with guest Prashanth Rao, a senior AI and data engineer at the Royal Bank of Canada. Rao offers a comprehensive overview of vector databases, highlighting their emergence as a critical tool for efficiently managing, storing, and querying data vectors at scale. Through an engaging discussion, they explore the nuances of vector databases, including the architectural decisions, trade-offs, and the potential impact on AI workflows and applications.

### Key Insights:
- **Definition and Importance of Vector Databases:** Vector databases are designed to handle vectors - compressed data representations containing semantic information - enabling queries that consider the semantics of the data, which is particularly relevant with the advent of transformers and large language models.
- **Evolution of Database Technologies:** The conversation traces the development from relational databases and NoSQL to the emergence of vector databases, situating them within the broader history of database technology and their unique capabilities for semantic search.
- **Trade-offs in Vector Database Selection:** Rao discusses several critical trade-offs to consider when choosing a vector database solution, including purpose-built versus incumbent vendors, external embedding pipelines, indexing speed versus querying speed, recall versus latency, and in-memory versus on-disk indexing.
- **Future of Vector Databases and AI:** The potential for combining vector databases with graph databases for enhanced retrieval-augmented generation and factual knowledge retrieval presents an exciting frontier for AI applications, allowing for more nuanced and complex queries.

### Memorable Quotes:
- "A vector database is a purpose-built database that efficiently manages, stores, and updates vectors at scale...and retrieves the most similar vectors to a given query, in a way that considers the semantics of the query." - Prashanth Rao
- "In-memory index versus on-disk index...is defining what you would call the race towards vector supremacy." - Prashanth Rao, on one of the key technical trade-offs in vector databases.
- "The combination of vector databases and LLMs...has kind of become available to the masses. The average company who does not have massive compute is still able to build very, very valuable search solutions." - Prashanth Rao, on the democratizing effect of vector databases and large language models.

### Actionable Takeaways:
- **Assessing Needs and Trade-offs:** When considering integrating a vector database into your AI workflow, it's crucial to evaluate the specific needs of your application, including the trade-offs between indexing speed, querying speed, in-memory versus on-disk storage, and whether you need a purpose-built vector database or can leverage existing database solutions.
- **Exploring Combinations with Other Technologies:** The future of AI applications may increasingly rely on the strategic combination of different technologies, such as vector databases with graph databases and large language models, to enable more sophisticated data retrieval and analysis capabilities.
- **Keeping an Eye on Emerging Solutions:** The field of vector databases is rapidly evolving, with new solutions offering various optimizations and capabilities. Staying informed about these developments can help you make better decisions for your AI projects.

### Outro:
This episode sheds light on the complex landscape of vector databases, providing listeners with a deeper understanding of their capabilities, considerations, and potential impact on the future of AI. As the technology continues to evolve, the strategic integration of vector databases with other AI technologies promises to unlock new possibilities for data analysis and retrieval.
