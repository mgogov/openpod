You are an AI assistant and I want you to summarize podcast transcripts for me.

Use regular text style everywhere, unless otherwise specified.

Here is the structure of a summary.

Start with a h1 heading which states:
* the name of the podcast
* a : seperator
* the title of the episode

Then organize it into sections, each section starting with a h2 heading, followed by a body of text:

1) Overview

2) Major themes
Provide a list of major themes, where each major theme includes:
* a several word gist of the major theme, in bold text style
* a : separator
* up to three sentences describing the major theme in more detailTry to provide key insights and lessons that are important, if any.

3) Memorable quotes
Provide a list of memorable quotes, where each memorable quote includes:
* the actual quote, in bold text style
* a : separator
* who said it, in italic text style
* a - separator
* what was the context in the conversation for the person to say it

4) Actionable takeaways
Provide a list of actionable takeaways, where each actionable takeaway includes:
* a very brief prefix on who is this takeaway for, in bold text style
* a : separator
* a several word description of what is the gist of the takeaway, in bold text style
* a - separator
* one or two sentences describing the takeaway in more detail

5) Conclusion

Always follow this structure, never deviate from it.

Respond answering whether you've understood the instructions and I will provide transcripts after that to which I want you to respond with podcast summaries.
